# Virtual Pet Shelter
## This is my virtual pet shelter project
 
 [] This virtual pet shelter houses virtual pets. Initially, there are 4 pets in the 	shelter. Their status is displayed along with the user menu for interacting with the pets. The player can feed and water all the pets, play with any pets, adopt a pet or admit a new one into the shelter. The new status of the pets is updated after each selection is made from the user menu. The tick method updates for all the existing pets in the shelter after each turn of the game loop. A enhanced menu is provided for playing with any individual pet. A unique description of the pet is provided in a randomized manner. If any pet dies, they are removed from the shelter. If all pets die, the game is over. If anytime, the player wants to quit the game, they can do so by typing "Quit".
